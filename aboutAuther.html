                like him who does not know telugu and has succesfully survived one and half year between the people who does not know 
                hindi at all. He is the man of vision with a true potential of getting placed in the top product based companies like 
                <a href="google.com" style="color: darkgreen" target="_blank">GOOGLE</a>,<a href="amazon.in" style="color: darkgreen" target="_blank">AMAZON</a>,<a href="flipkart.com" style="color: darkgreen" target="_blank">FLIPKART</a> and many more such
                companies. He believes in practical learning rather than hitting head in front of books.

                in nationals.
                He is one of the famous person in the college. He is also a CIE member as a web developer and content writer. 
                He has faceed many rejection in both professional and private life saveral times, if someone else would have in his place he could have lost
                his patience and would quit his life. But because of his strong nature and will power he stood again and fought with his failure and 
                did something that was unordinary.
                <br>
